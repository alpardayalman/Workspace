### Linked List
<table>
<td>
  
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

</td>

### Stacks
<table>
<td>
  
In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
